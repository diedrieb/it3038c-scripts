What This Script Does
_______________________

For this project, I developed a python script that will tell us the time across all three United States Time Zones
(Eastern, Central, Pacific). 

The Ouput 
___________

The output of this script will be three lines consisting of each time zone's current time in hours, minutes,
and seconds. This will be clearly visible as the descriptions also will come before the time. 

How To Run It
_______________

This script is coded in Python, so it can be run in any IDE such as VS Code or Python IDE. Once inside of an IDE, 
you csan locate the run function and run the code. The output should then appear in a terminal window.
