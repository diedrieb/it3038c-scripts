What This Script Does

This script is a way for a user to create a username and have a unique, strong password generated for them. In a world where a majority of cyber attacks are caused by weak passwords, this script will allow for a user to see what strong passwords should look like. This script also creates a QR code with a link to a webpage that gives tips on creating strong passwords. We also have a login function that will imitate an authentication system and use loops to show what happens if the credntials are entered correcttly or incorrectly. 

The Ouput

The output of this script will display a line of input options and outcomes to those inputs. We will be able to enter a custom username and will then receive a unique, generated password. We will then be prompted to login and this requires case sensitive input of credentials in order to successfully login. This script will also create a unique QR code for the webpage we have listed in the script. 

How To Run It

This script is coded in Python, so it can be run in any IDE such as VS Code or Python IDE. Once inside of the IDE (recommended VS Code), the user will need to open a terminal and enter the lines "pip install pyqrcode" and "pip install pypng". After this is complete, the user should save the file to an area of their local machine of their choice. Remember this location because this is where the QR code will be generated. Once these are entered and installed, restart VS code. Once back inside of an IDE, you can locate the run function and run the code. The output should then appear in a terminal window. The QR code can be found and opened in the python file's saved location. Using your phone's camera, scan the QR code and learn some good password techniques!
