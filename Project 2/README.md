What This Script Does
_______________________

For this project, I developed a python script that will tell us the time across all three United States Time Zones
(Eastern, Central, Pacific) as well as display the current date with the year, month, and day. This script also is used for telling 
the user what all of the holidays are this year in the United States as well as their date. These are the upgrades I made to my Project 1 script. 

The Ouput 
___________

The output of this script will be three lines consisting of each time zone's current time in hours, minutes,
and seconds. This will be clearly visible as the descriptions also will come before the time. This outut will display the current
year, month, and day to the user as well as all of the holidays that are to be celebrated in the US during 2022.

How To Run It
_______________

This script is coded in Python, so it can be run in any IDE such as VS Code or Python IDE. Once inside of the IDE (recommended VS Code), the user will
need to open a terminal and enter the lines "pip install pytz" and "pip install holidays". Once these are entered and installed, restart 
VS code. Once back inside of an IDE, you can locate the run function and run the code. The output should then appear in a terminal window.
